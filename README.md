# Student-Report-Card-System  
> *A report card is used to assess student performance in education, sport, discipline, etc.  
> *It is utilized in schools and education institutes almost everywhere.  
> *This report card has been around for decades and will be around for years.  
> *But the burden of organizing the report card by teaching professionals subsists.  
> *It is not possible for the teachers to create the report in less time and manage it all the time.  
> *As a result, we intend to create a student scorecard system so that it stores all student records, and we can access them anywhere and anytime.  
> *This system was designed to eliminate repetitive tasks and thus save time.  
> *We simply used programming C to carry out that project.  
> *It can be used to create a student report card, search a particular record by the student roll number or class, sort the students based on their exam performance and grade, display all the records at a time, etc.  
> *This proposed system will store all student records along with their grades and report cards, enabling teachers and administrators to retrieve these records as required.  
> *We believe this will be a great replacement for the current system.
